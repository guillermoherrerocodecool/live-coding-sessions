TShirt Printing Company Management

DDD (Domain Driven Development)

A tshirt company wants to be able to digitalize the selling of their merchandising.
Customers should have an id and an email address to contact them when their purchase is ready.
Tshirts have an id, a url reference where to find the picture to print on it, three different colors: white, black, blue; and three different sizes: S, M, L.
A purchase has an id, the price and a timestamp, a customer as well, and a tshirt

Implement the following methods:
- calculate the revenue of this month
- calculate how many tshirts have been sold by color and size
- find the (one) customer who has purchased the biggest amount of tshirts
